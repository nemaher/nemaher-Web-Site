<h3>Project-6 Arrays - In Class Exercises</h3>
<hr />
<p>Please complete the following exercises on this page. When complete post the   page to your WDV221 folder on the server. Make a link in your WDV221 Intro   Javascript page for this assignment. Contact your instructor and demonstrate   that you have completed the assignment. </p>
<p>Using Blackboard complete the In Class Exercise Assignment. Download your   Homework project and being working on it with your remaining time. </p>
<h3>For each exercise use a comment line to put the Exercise number within the   script. Also place a short description of what the script is doing.</h3>
<hr />
<p>For each of the following use the teams array provided in the script of this page. </p>
<p>1. Display the array in an alert.</p>
<p>2. Display the first row of the array in an alert.</p>
<p>3. Use a for loop to write each row of the array out to this page. Each row should be in a paragraph.</p>
<script>// 3. writing the teams array on the page in individual paragraphs
for(var i = 0 ; i< teams.length ; i++){
	document.write("<p>" + teams[i] + "</p>");
}
</script>
<p>4. Use a while loop to write each row of the array out to this page. Each row should be in a paragraph.</p>
<script>//this writes the team array to the screen in separate paragraphs
var i = 0;
while(i < teams.length){
	document.write("<p>" + teams[i] + "</p>");
	i++;
}

</script>
<p>5. Use a loop to write out each row of the array as list items within the following list.</p>
<ul>
List of Team Names
<script>//5. writes team names to the screen in an unordered list
for (var i = 0; i < teams.length; i++){
	document.write("<li>" + teams[i] + "</li>");
}
</script>
</ul>
<p>6. Create an array called scores. It will have three rows. Load a 0 into each row. This is a parallel array to teams. </p>
<p>7. Use a loop to write out each row of the scores array as list items in the following list. </p>
<ul>Team Scores
<script>//7. scores array are placed in an unordered list
for(var i = 0; i < scores.length; i++){
	document.write("<li>" + scores[i] + "</li>");	
}
</script>
</ul>
<p>8. Create a function called displayTeams( ). It will use a loop to write out the Team name and score in the same paragraph. Run the function. Your output should look like:</p>
<p>Hustlers	0</p>
<script>
displayTeams();//running the displayTeams function
</script>
<p>9. Write a loop that will 3 to each value in the scores array. Run the displayTeams( ) function to display the update scores. </p>
<script>
displayTeams()
</script>
<p>10. Write a function that will search the team array for a given name. If it finds the name it will display the team's score. If not a message &quot;Team is not listed' will be displayed. HINT: Check your notes for an example to start with. Activate this function with a button. </p>
<script>//10. searches the arrays for the teams and displayes their score in an alert
function getScores(){
var teamToFind = document.getElementById("teamLookUp").value;
var teamScore = "Team not found.";
	for(var i = 0; i < teams.length; i++)
	{
		//see if we have the team in the Teams array
		if(teamToFind == teams[i])
		{
			//if found
			teamScore = scores[i];
			break;
		}
	}
document.getElementById("teamScore").value = teamScore;
}
</script>
 <table width="24%" border="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="39%">Team Name:</td>
      <td width="61%"><input type="text" name="textfield" id="teamLookUp" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Score:</td>
      <td><input type="text" name="textfield2" id="teamScore" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<input type="button" value="Search for team score" onclick="getScores()"/>
